    - [films.json]

- Create at least 2 React custom components and display them on your main page:
    - At least one custom component should be a "parent" of another functional React component
    - At least one other custom component should be a "child" React component

- Use the import keyword to bring your JSON data into your component files
- Use the import keyword to add your components to your App.js file
- Make sure each component can properly render some list of JSON object properties
- Demonstrate next generation JavaScript usage in your components including new operators and array methods
- Commit and push your source files into a Git repository named something like "initial-react-app"      
    - [initialProject]
    - Be sure your repo includes a ReadMe.md file.  Inside that ReadMe file use Markdown notation to list the features of your app
